install node.js on your pc or laptop.

after you've done that open your cmd in the file location of jam master.

you need to get animaljam in your web browser, I did this by using an old firefox version with flash. you need to block classic.animaljam.com
or it will redirect you there and search ""animal jam create an account"" go to the animal jam create account and login to your account. you can follow the instructions of
jam master from there. if you cant understand this then this program isnt for you

i am working on rewriting jam master currently.
